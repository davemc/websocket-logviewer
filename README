Apache access log viewer using the simile timeline http://simile-widgets.org/
Will probably not work unless your log entries have the following format:
127.0.0.1 - - [22/Jul/2010:09:04:10 +0200] GET /index.html?a=1&b=2 HTTP/1.0 304 -


1. mvn package to build

2. Make sure websocket-logviewer.jar and netty-3.2.1.Final.jar are in the same directory.

3. Create a properties file logfiles.properties in the same directory
Add the following properties:
	HOSTNAME=<the host name for your server>
	PORT=<the port for your server>
	filename1=<full path to a file you wish the user to be able to see>
	filename2=<second file>
You can add as many unique filename properties as you wish, so long as they start with "filename" they will be added to the list of available files.

4. Change to the install directory and run:
	java -jar websocket-logviewer.jar

That's it, point your WebSockets cabable browser at http://<HOSTNAME>:<PORT> select a file and start logging.
